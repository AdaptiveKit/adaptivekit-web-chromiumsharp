<p>With ChromiumSharp you can easily leverage the power of HTML5 from within your .NET/Mono applications. Lovingly built on solid foundations so you can focus on your next masterpiece and not the tricky bits; because we ♥ what we do. </p>

<p>ChromiumSharp is a sub-project of <a href="http://adaptivekit.github.com">AdaptiveKit</a> – check us out.</p>

<h2>Le Project</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to provide a stable yet cutting-edge version of the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> web browser engine that is embeddable into .NET/Mono applications and compatible with the latest Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. The project contains everything you need to start working on your next cool application without having to spend time with all the fiddly bits particular to each of the supported operating systems. </p>

<p>The code is sourced from carefully selected revisions for each of the <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveKit/adaptivekit-web-chromiumsharp">ChromiumSharp</a> project dependencies. Those projects are chain-compiled on each of the supported operating systems to ensure the maximum consistency in the resulting binaries across platforms.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveKit/adaptivekit-web-chromiumsharp">ChromiumSharp</a> is a sub-project of <a href="http://adaptivekit.github.com">AdaptiveKit</a> and is at the heart of many other related sub-projects and, as such, we take special care to make sure everything is as smooth as possible. We eat our own dogfood... so we want a rock solid build.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the work.</p>

<h3>About Chromium</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web. It’s a colossal collection of projects (that includes <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a>) that make up the foundation on which the <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveKit/adaptivekit-web-chromiumsharp">ChromiumSharp</a> project is built. If you wish to “roll your own” Chromium check out their <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">site</a> – be warned, arm yourself with plenty patience and Diet Coke… it’s going to be a long build! </p>

<p>The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the BSD license, with other parts being subject to a variety of different permissive open-source licenses, including the MIT License, the LGPL, the Ms-PL and an MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license.</p>

<h3>About Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/">Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</a> is an open source project founded in 2008 to develop a web browser control based on the Google Chromium project. CEF currently supports a range of programming languages and operating systems and can be easily integrated into both new and existing applications while taking advantage of the same performance and HTML5 technologies available in the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> web browser. Kudos and much ♥ to Marshall Greenblatt for this excellent piece of work.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/">CEF</a> is released under the new BSD license; you can read specifics <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/source/browse/trunk/cef3/LICENSE.txt">here</a>.</p>
